# Hello, World!

Let's write and execute a smart contract on Cardano in 10 minutes. Yes, you read
that well.

You can find code supporting this tutorial on [Aiken's main repository](https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken/tree/main/examples/hello_world).

## Pre-requisites

We'll use `Aiken` to write the script, and
[`Lucid`](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid) to construct and submit the
transaction. So make sure you have your dev environment ready for some
TypeScript<sup>★</sup> and have Aiken installed already.

<Callout type="info">
  ★ For TypeScript, we recommend installing
  [deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.1/getting_started/installation).
</Callout>

## Scaffolding

First, let's create a new `Aiken` project:

```
aiken new aiken-lang/hello_world
cd hello_world
```

This command scaffolds an Aiken project. In particular, it creates a `lib` and `validators` folders in which you can put Aiken source files.

```
./hello_world
│
├── README.md
├── aiken.toml
├── lib
│   └── hello_world
└── validators
```

## Using the standard library

We'll use the [standard library](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib) for writing our validator. Fortunately, `aiken new` did automatically add the standard
library to our `aiken.toml` for us. It should look roughly like that:

```toml filename="aiken.toml"
name = "aiken-lang/hello_world"
description = "Aiken contracts for project 'aiken-lang/hello_world'"
version = "0.0.0"
license  = "Apache-2.0"

[repository]
user = 'aiken-lang'
project = 'hello_world'
platform = 'github'

[[dependencies]]
name = "aiken-lang/stdlib"
version = "main"
source = "github"
```

Now, running `aiken check`, we should see dependencies being downloaded. That shouldn't take long.

```
❯ aiken check

    Compiling aiken-lang/hello_world 0.0.0 (/Users/aiken/Projects/aiken-lang/hello_world)

Summary
    0 error, 0 warning(s)
```

## Our first validator

Let's write our first validator as `validators/hello_world.ak`:

```aiken filename="validators/hello_world.ak"
use aiken/hash.{Blake2b_224, Hash}
use aiken/list
use aiken/transaction.{ScriptContext}
use aiken/transaction/credential.{VerificationKey}

type Datum {
  owner: Hash<Blake2b_224, VerificationKey>,
}

type Redeemer {
  msg: ByteArray,
}

validator hello_world {
  fn(datum: Datum, redeemer: Redeemer, context: ScriptContext) -> Bool {
    let must_say_hello = redeemer.msg == "Hello, World!"

    let must_be_signed =
      list.has(context.transaction.extra_signatories, datum.owner)

    must_say_hello && must_be_signed
  }
}
```

Our first validator is rudimentary. It is parameterized by a verification key hash (`owner`) and a message (`msg`). Remember that, in the eUTxO model, the datum is set when locking funds in the contract and can be therefore seen as configuration. Here, we'll indicate the owner of contract and require a signature from them to unlock funds -- very much like it already works on a typical non-script address. Moreover, because there's no "Hello, World!" without a proper "Hello, World!" our little contract also demands this very message, as a UTF-8-encoded byte array, to be passed as redeemer (i.e. when spending from the contract).

It's now time to build our first contract!

```
aiken build
```

This generate a [CIP-0057 Plutus blueprint](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/258) as `plutus.json` at the root of your project. This blueprint describes your on-chain contract and its binary interface. In particular, it contains the generated on-chain code that will be executed by the ledger, and a hash of your validator(s) that can be used to construct addresses.

This format is framework-agnostic and is meant to facilitate interoperability between tools. The blueprint is fully integrated into Aiken, which can automatically generates it based on your type definitions and comments.

Let's see the validator in action!

## Getting funds

Before moving one, we'll need some funds, and a public/private key pair to hold them. We can generate a private key and an address using `Lucid`.

Let's write our first script as `generate-credentials.ts`:

```ts filename="generate-credentials.ts"
import { Lucid } from "https://deno.land/x/lucid@0.8.3/mod.ts";

const lucid = await Lucid.new(undefined, "Preview");

const privateKey = lucid.utils.generatePrivateKey();
await Deno.writeTextFile("key.sk", privateKey);

const address = await lucid
  .selectWalletFromPrivateKey(privateKey)
  .wallet.address();
await Deno.writeTextFile("key.addr", address);
```

Now, we can head to [the Cardano faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet) to get some funds on the preview network to our newly created address (inside `key.addr`). Make sure to select _"Preview Testnet"_ as network.

Using [CardanoScan](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/) we can watch for the faucet sending some ADA our way. This should be pretty fast.

## Using the contract

Now that we have some funds, we can lock them in our newly created contract. We'll use [`Lucid`](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid) to construct and submit our transaction through Blockfrost.

<Callout type="info">
  This is only one example of possible setup using tools we love. For more
  tools, make sure to check out the [Cardano Developer
  Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/tools)!
</Callout>

### Setup

First, we setup Lucid with Blockfrost as a provider. This will allow us to let Lucid handle transaction building for us, which includes managing changes. It also gives us a direct way to submit the transaction later on.

Create a file named `hello_world-lock.ts` in the root of your project and add the following code:

```ts filename="hello_world-lock.ts"
import {
  Blockfrost,
  C,
  Constr,
  Data,
  Lucid,
  SpendingValidator,
  TxHash,
  fromHex,
  toHex,
  utf8ToHex,
} from "https://deno.land/x/lucid@0.8.3/mod.ts";
import * as cbor from "https://deno.land/x/cbor@v1.4.1/index.js";

const lucid = await Lucid.new(
  new Blockfrost(
    "https://cardano-preview.blockfrost.io/api/v0",
    Deno.env.get("BLOCKFROST_API_KEY")
  ),
  "Preview"
);
```

### Reading The Blueprint

Next, we'll need to read the validator from the blueprint we generated earlier. We'll also need to convert it to a format that Lucid understands. This is done by encoding the validator as CBOR and then converting it to hex as shown below:

```ts filename="hello_world-lock.ts"
lucid.selectWalletFromPrivateKey(await Deno.readTextFile("./key.sk"));

const validator = await readValidator();

// --- Supporting functions

async function readValidator(): Promise<SpendingValidator> {
  const validator = JSON.parse(await Deno.readTextFile("plutus.json"))
    .validators[0];
  return {
    type: "PlutusV2",
    script: toHex(cbor.encode(fromHex(validator.compiledCode))),
  };
}
```

### Finishing The Locking Contract Logic

Now that we can read our validator, we can make our first transaction to lock funds into the contract. The datum
must match the representation expected by the script, so this is a constructor
with a single field that is a byte array.

As value for that byte array, we provide a hash digest of our public key. This
will be needed to unlock the funds.

```ts filename="hello_world-lock.ts"
const publicKeyHash = lucid.utils.getAddressDetails(
  await lucid.wallet.address()
).paymentCredential?.hash;

const datum = Data.to(new Constr(0, [publicKeyHash]));

const txHash = await lock(BigInt(1000000), { into: validator, owner: datum });

await lucid.awaitTx(txHash);

console.log(`1 ADA locked into the contract at:
    Tx Hash: ${txHash}
    Datum: ${datum}
`);

// --- Supporting functions

async function lock(
  lovelace: bigint,
  { into, owner }: { into: SpendingValidator; owner: string }
): Promise<TxHash> {
  const contractAddress = lucid.utils.validatorToAddress(into);

  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .payToContract(contractAddress, { inline: owner }, { lovelace })
    .complete();

  const signedTx = await tx.sign().complete();

  return signedTx.submit();
}
```

### Publishing The Locking Contract

Run the excerpt above by executing:

```
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env hello_world-lock.ts
```

The above code requires you to:

- have a `BLOCKFROST_API_KEY` environment variable set. You can get one by [signing up for a Blockfrost account](https://blockfrost.io/).

- have this file (`hello_world-lock.ts`) is placed at the root of your `hello_world` folder.

At this stage, your folder should looks roughly like this:

```
./hello_world
│
├── README.md
├── aiken.toml
├── plutus.json
├── hello_world-lock.ts
├── key.addr
├── key.sk
├── lib
│   └── ...
└── validators
    └── hello_world.ak
```

If everything went well, you should see something like this:

```
% deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env hello_world-lock.ts

1 ADA locked into the contract at:
    Tx Hash: 8559f57234407204d8e9a6bf57ef6943c65ec7119eb1c2ca6224f8bad8e71c1e
    Datum: d8799f581c10073fd2997d2f7dc6dadcf24966bd06b01930e5210e5de7aebf792dff

```

### Inspecting The Transaction

Now is a good moment to pause and have a look at CardanoScan. Here's [an example of an _Hello World_ transaction](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/transaction/8559f57234407204d8e9a6bf57ef6943c65ec7119eb1c2ca6224f8bad8e71c1e?tab=utxo) that we generated using this tutorial.

If you notice the small icon next to the contract output address, we can even [inspect the datum](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/datumInspector?datum=d8799f581c10073fd2997d2f7dc6dadcf24966bd06b01930e5210e5de7aebf792dff):

```json filename="d8799f581c10073fd2997d2f7dc6dadcf24966bd06b01930e5210e5de7aebf792dff"
{
  "constructor": 0,
  "fields": [
    {
      "bytes": "10073fd2997d2f7dc6dadcf24966bd06b01930e5210e5de7aebf792d"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Unlocking Funds From The Contract

Finally, as a last step: we now want to spend the UTxO that is locked by our
`hello_world` contract.

To be valid, our transaction must meet two conditions:

- it must provide "Hello, World!" as a redeemer; and
- it must be signed by the key referenced as datum (i.e the owner).

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that we need to explicitly add a signer using `.addSigner` so that it
  gets added to the `extra_signatories` of our transaction -- and becomes
  accessible for our script.
</Callout>

Let's make a new file `hello_world-unlock.ts` and copy over some of the boilerplate
from the first one.

```ts filename="hello_world-unlock.ts"
import {
  Blockfrost,
  C,
  Constr,
  Data,
  Lucid,
  SpendingValidator,
  TxHash,
  fromHex,
  toHex,
  utf8ToHex,
} from "https://deno.land/x/lucid@0.8.3/mod.ts";
import * as cbor from "https://deno.land/x/cbor@v1.4.1/index.js";

const lucid = await Lucid.new(
  new Blockfrost(
    "https://cardano-preview.blockfrost.io/api/v0",
    Deno.env.get("BLOCKFROST_API_KEY")
  ),
  "Preview"
);

lucid.selectWalletFromPrivateKey(await Deno.readTextFile("./key.sk"));

const validator = await readValidator();

// --- Supporting functions

async function readValidator(): Promise<SpendingValidator> {
  const validator = JSON.parse(await Deno.readTextFile("plutus.json"))
    .validators[0];
  return {
    type: "PlutusV2",
    script: toHex(cbor.encode(fromHex(validator.compiledCode))),
  };
}
```

Now, let's add the bits to unlock the funds in the contract. We'll need the
transaction hash obtained when you ran the previous script
(`hello_world-lock.ts`)

That transaction hash, and the corresponding output index (here, `0`)
uniquely identify the UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) in which the funds
are currently locked. And that's the one we're about to unlock.

```ts filename="hello_world-unlock.ts"
const utxo: OutRef = { txHash: Deno.args[0], outputIndex: 0 };

const redeemer = Data.to(new Constr(0, [utf8ToHex("Hello, World!")]));

const unlockTxHash = await unlock(utxo, {
  from: validator,
  using: redeemer,
});

await lucid.awaitTx(unlockTxHash);

console.log(`1 ADA unlocked from the contract
    Tx Hash: ${unlockTxHash}
    Redeemer: ${redeemer}
`);

// --- Supporting functions

async function unlock(
  ref: OutRef,
  { from, using }: { from: SpendingValidator; using: Redeemer }
): Promise<TxHash> {
  const [utxo] = await lucid.utxosByOutRef([ref]);

  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .collectFrom([utxo], using)
    .addSigner(await lucid.wallet.address())
    .attachSpendingValidator(from)
    .complete();

  const signedTx = await tx.sign().complete();

  return signedTx.submit();
}
```

Run this script with the transaction hash obtained from the previous command locking the funds:

```
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env hello_world-unlock.ts 8559f57234407204d8e9a6bf57ef6943c65ec7119eb1c2ca6224f8bad8e71c1e
```

If everything worked as planned you should see something resembling the following output:

```
1 ADA unlocked from the contract
    Tx Hash: d3d5e828a3989691b0960d22a265c8c9ae4723134b52aa05ec0fb7d40f060392
    Redeemer: d8799f4d48656c6c6f2c20576f726c6421ff

```

And, tada 🎉!

We can inspect our [redeeming transaction on CardanoScan](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/transaction/d3d5e828a3989691b0960d22a265c8c9ae4723134b52aa05ec0fb7d40f060392?tab=contracts) and see that it successfully executed our _Hello World_ contract.
