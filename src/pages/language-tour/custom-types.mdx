# Custom types

Aiken's custom types are named collections of keys and/or values. They are
similar to objects in object oriented languages, though they don't have
methods.

Custom types are defined with the `type` keyword.

```aiken
type Datum {
  Datum { signer: ByteArray, count: Int }
}
```

Here we have defined a custom type called `Datum`. Its constructor is called
`Datum` and it has two fields: A `signer` field which is a `ByteArray`, and a
`count` field which is an `Int`.

Once defined the custom type can be used in functions:

```aiken
fn datums() {
  // Fields can be given in any order
  let datum1 = Datum { signer: #[0xAA, 0xBB], count: 2001 }
  let datum2 = Datum { count: 1805, signer: #[0xAA, 0xCC] }

  [datum1, datum1]
}
```

## Shorthand notation

Because single constructors are quite common, there exists a special shorthand
notation when the type and the constructor have the same name. So instead of
the above, one can write:

```aiken
type Datum {
  signer: ByteArray,
  count: Int
}
```

These two notations are synonym. With the shorthand, we implicitly indicate
that there's a single constructor named `Datum` which can be used for
constructing values of type `Datum`, or can also be used when destructuring
(see below).

## Multiple constructors

Custom types in Aiken can be defined with multiple constructors, making them a
way of modeling data that can be one of a few different variants.

We've already seen a custom type with multiple constructors in the Language
Tour - [`Bool`](./primitive-types#bool).

Aiken's built-in `Bool` type is defined like this:

```aiken
/// A Bool is a value that is either `True` or `False`
type Bool {
  True
  False
}
```

It's a simple custom type with constructors that takes no arguments at all!
Use it to answer yes/no questions and to indicate whether something is `True`
or `False`.

The records created by different constructors for a custom type can contain
different values. For example a `User` custom type could have a `LoggedIn`
constructor that creates records with a name, and a `Guest` constructor which
creates records without any contained values.

```aiken
type User {
  LoggedIn { count: Int }  // A logged in user
  Guest                    // A guest user with no details
}
```

```aiken
let user1 = LoggedIn { count: 4 }
let user2 = LoggedIn { count: 2 }
let visitor = Guest
```

### Option

We define `Option` as a generic type like so:

```ak
type Option<a> {
  None
  Some(a)
}
```

Then, functions which fail may safely return an optional value.

```ak
fn get_head(a: List<a>) -> Option<a> {
  when a is {
    [a, ..] -> Some(a)
    [] -> None
  }
}
```

The `Option` type is readily available in Aiken; it is part of the default types and values available by default. Don't hesitate to use it!

## Destructuring

When given a custom type record we can pattern match on it to determine which
record constructor matches, and to assign names to any contained values.

```aiken
fn get_name(user) {
  when user is {
    LoggedIn { count } -> count
    Guest -> "Guest user"
  }
}
```

Custom types can also be destructured with a `let` binding.

```aiken
type Score {
  Points(Int)
}

let score = Points(50)
let Points(p) = score // This brings a let-binding `p` in scope.

p // 50
```

During destructuring you may also use discards (`_`) or spreads (`..`).

```aiken
type Dog {
  Dog { name: ByteArray, cuteness: Int, age: Int }
}

let dog = Dog { name: #"436173686577", cuteness: 9001, age: 3 }
```

You will need to specify all args for a pattern match, or alternatively use the
spread operator.

```aiken
// All fields present
let Dog { name: name, cuteness: _, age: _ } = dog
builtin.decode_utf8(name) // "Cashew"

// Other fields ignored by spreading.
// Field punning is supported. Hence `age` is a shorthand for `age: age`.
let Dog { age, .. } = dog
age // 3
```

## Named accessors

If a custom type has only one variant and named fields they can be accessed
using `.field_name`.

For example using the `Dog` type defined earlier.

```aiken
let dog = Dog { name: #[82, 105, 110], cuteness: 2001 }
dog.cuteness // This returns 2001
```

## Generics

Custom types can be be parameterised with other types, making their contents
variable.

For example, this `Box` type is a simple record that holds a single value.

```aiken
type Box<inner_type> {
  Box(inner: inner_type)
}
```

The type of the field `inner` is `inner_type`, which is a parameter of the `Box`
type. If it holds an int the box's type is `Box<Int>`, if it holds a string the
box's type is `Box<String>`.

```aiken
fn foo() {
  let a = Box(420) // type is Box<Int>
  let b = Box("That's my ninja way!") // type is Box<String>
}
```

## Record updates

Aiken provides a dedicated syntax for updating some of the fields of a custom
type record.

```aiken
type Person {
  name: ByteArray,
  shoe_size: Int,
  age: Int,
  is_happy: Bool,
}

fn have_birthday(person) {
  // It's this person's birthday, so increment their age and
  // make them happy
  Person { ..person, age: person.age + 1, is_happy: True }
}
```

The update syntax created a new record with the values of the initial record.
It replaces the given binding with their new values.

## Type aliases

A type alias lets you create a name which is identical to
another type, without any additional information.

```aiken
type MyNumber = Int
```

They are most useful for simplifying type signatures.

```aiken
type Person = (String, Int)

fn create_person(name: String, age: Int) -> Person {
  (name, age)
}
```

## Data

At runtime custom types become an opaque Plutus' Data. In Aiken's type system
`Data` matches with any user-defined type (but with none of the primitive
types).

Thus, it's also possible to cast any [custom type](./custom-types.md) into
`Data`. Extracting from `Data` however requires the use of [expect](#expect)

```aiken
fn to_datum(datum: Data) -> Datum {
    expect d: Datum = datum
    d
}
```

Note that this conversion will fail if the given `Data` isn't actually a valid
representation of the target type. The primary use-case here is for
instantiating script contexts, datums and redeemers provided to scripts in an
opaque fashion.

It's also useful for interacting with builtins that operate on raw `Data`. In
this case, the conversation happens implicitly. Simply expect any function that
accepts `Data` to automatically work on any custom type.

```aiken
type Datum {
  count: Int,
}

let datum = Datum { count: 1 }

// fn(Data) -> ByteArray
builtin.serialise_data(datum) // some bytearray
```

### expect

`expect` is a special keyword which works like `let`, but allows to perform
some potentially unsafe conversions. There are two main use cases for it:

#### Non-exhaustive pattern matching

In cases where you have a value of a type that has multiple constructor
variants, but are only truly interested in one of the possible variants as outcomes
(i.e. any other outcomes invalidate the program), then `expect` is the perfect tool. Consider the `Option` type from above in the following example:

```aiken
let x = Some(42)

// As a pattern-match
let y = when x is {
  None -> ???
  Some(y) -> y
}

// Using expect
expect Some(y) = x
```

#### Casting from `Data` into a custom type

Another crucial use of `expect` is to turn some opaque `Data` into a concrete
representation. In the context of a Cardano smart-contract, we can encounter
`Data` in various places although in general it's most likely when dealing with the datums attached to outputs.

Often, we do expect a specific structure for some given datum, and so being able
to safely relay those assumptions in the validators comes in handy.

The syntax is identical to the other use case, but it requires an explicit type
annotation.

```aiken
type MyDatum {
  foo: Int,
  bar: ByteArray,
}

fn to_my_datum(data: Data) -> MyDatum {
  expect my_datum: MyDatum = data
  my_datum
}
