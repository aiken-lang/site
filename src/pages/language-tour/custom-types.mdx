# Custom types

## Defining custom types

### Basics

Aiken's custom types are named collections of keys and/or values. They are
similar to objects in object-oriented languages, though they don't have
methods.

Custom types are defined with the `type{:ak}` keyword. They may contain named
fields, or not; but they cannot mix.

```aiken
// With named fields
type Datum {
  Datum { signer: ByteArray, count: Int }
}

// With unnamed fields
type DatumNameless {
  DatumNameless(ByteArray, Int)
}
```

Here we have defined two custom types called `Datum{:ak}` and `DatumNameless{:ak}` respectively.

The constructor of `Datum{:ak}` is called `Datum{:ak}` and it has two fields: A
`signer{:ak}` field which is a `ByteArray{:ak}`, and a `count{:ak}` field which
is an `Int{:ak}`. Likewise, the constructor of `DatumNameless{:ak}` also has two fields
of types `ByteArray{:ak}` and `Int{:ak}`.

Once defined the custom type can be used in functions to create values by calling their constructors.

```aiken
fn datums() {
  // Named fields can be given in any order
  let named_1 = Datum { signer: #[0xAA, 0xBB], count: 2001 }
  let named_2 = Datum { count: 1805, signer: #[0xAA, 0xCC] }

  // Nameless fields are given as positional arguments
  let nameless_1 = DatumNameless(#[0xAA, 0xBB], 2001)

  //Event-named fields can be given as positional arguments.
  let named_3 = Datum(#[0xAA, 0xBB], 2001)

  (named_1, named_2, nameless_1, named_3)
}
```

### Shorthand notation

Because single constructors are quite common, there exists a special shorthand
notation when the type and the constructor have the same name. So instead of
the above, one can write:

```aiken
type Datum {
  signer: ByteArray,
  count: Int
}
```

These two notations (with or without the constructor) are synonyms. With the
shorthand, we implicitly indicate that there's a single constructor named
`Datum` which can be used for constructing values of type `Datum`, or can also
be used when destructuring (see below).

### Multiple constructors

Custom types in Aiken can be defined with multiple constructors (a.k.a variants), making them a
way of modeling data that can be one of a few different variants.

We've already seen custom types with multiple constructors in the Language
Tour like [`Bool{:ak}`](./primitive-types#bool) or [`Option{:ak}`](./primitive-types#option).

Aiken's built-in `Bool` type is defined like this:

```aiken
/// A Bool is a value that is either `True` or `False`
type Bool {
  False
  True
}
```

It's a simple custom type with constructors that takes no arguments at all! Use
it to answer yes/no questions and to indicate whether something is `True{:ak}`
or `False{:ak}`.

The records created by different constructors for a custom type can contain
different values. For example, a `User{:ak}` custom type could have a `LoggedIn`
constructor that creates records with a name, and a `Guest` constructor which
creates records without any contained values.

```aiken
type User {
  LoggedIn { username: ByteArray }  // A logged in user
  Guest // A guest user with no details
}
```

```aiken
let user1 = LoggedIn { username: "Alice" }
let user2 = LoggedIn { username: "Bob" }
let visitor = Guest
```

### Generics

Custom types can be parameterized with other types, making their contents
variable. We've seen that with the [`Option{:ak}`](./primitive-types#option).

Let consider another example with a `Box{:ak}` type that is a simple record that
holds a single value.

```aiken
type Box<inner_type> {
  Box(inner: inner_type)
}
```

The type of the field `inner{:ak}` is `inner_type{:ak}`, which is a parameter of the `Box{:ak}`
type. If it holds an `Int{:ak}` the box's type is `Box<Int>{:ak}`, if it holds a string the
box's type is `Box<ByteArray>{:ak}`.

```aiken
fn foo() {
  let a = Box(420) // type is Box<Int>
  let b = Box("That's my ninja way!") // type is Box<ByteArray>
}
```

## Inspecting custom types

### Named accessors

If a custom type **has only one constructor** and **named fields** they can be
accessed using the _dot_ symbol (`.{:ak}`), followed by the name of the field.

For example, considering a type `Dog`:

```aiken
type Dog {
  name: ByteArray,
  cuteness: Int,
  age: Int,
}
```

We can access any of its fields using `.name{:ak}`, `.cuteness{:ak}` and
`.age{:ak}` respectively.

```aiken
let dog = Dog { name: "bob", cuteness: 2001, age: 6 }
dog.name // This returns "bob"
dog.cuteness // This returns 2001
dog.age // This returns 6
```

### Destructuring

Values can be can be _destructured_ in Aiken. Destructuring is the opposite of
constructing a value and uses a similar syntax albeit reversed. When
**constructing**, constructors and fields appears on the **right-hand side** of
an assignment. When **destructuring**, they appear on the **left-hand side**.

To keep rolling with our `Dog{:ak}` example, we have the following equivalence:

```aiken
// Constructing
let dog = Dog { name: "bob", cuteness: 2001, age: 6 }

// Destructuring
let Dog { name, cuteness, age } = dog
name == "bob" // True
cuteness == 2001 // True
age == 6 // True

// Equivalent to
let name = dog.name
let cuteness = dog.cuteness
let age = dog.age
```

As you can see, the second expression introduces three new bindings in scope
for `name{:ak}`, `cuteness{:ak}` and `dog{:ak}` respectively. Destructuring
works here because the associated type has a single constructor and the
identifiers we introduce have the same names as the fields. If needed, we can
however rename fields using a colon symbol (`:{:ak}`), like so:

```aiken
// Destructuring
let Dog { name: its_name, cuteness, age: its_age } = dog
its_name == "bob" // True
its_age == 6 // True
```

Note that we can also destructure constructors whose fields are nameless by
introducing identifiers for each of the fields. Like for constructing, when
treated as nameless fields, the arguments are positional.

```aiken
// Destructuring nameless
let Dog(name, cuteness, age) = dog
name == "bob" // True
cuteness == 2001 // True
age == 6 // True

// Destructuring nameless, arguments swapped.
let Dog(age, name, cuteness) = dog
age == "bob" // Confusing, but True
name == 2001 // Confusing, but True
cuteness == 6 // Confusing, but True
```

### Pattern-matching

For nameless fields, one must resort to _pattern-matching_ using the `when
*expr* is{:ak}` keywords. This syntax allows the inspection of a value following the
various branches defined by a type, ensuring that all possible paths are
properly handled.  Said differently, it is like asking the compiler "If the
data has this shape then do that", for all possible shapes.

Recall our `User{:ak}` type from before?

```aiken
type User {
  LoggedIn { username: ByteArray }
  Guest
}
```

Let's write a function `get_name{:ak}` that pulls out the name of a `User{:ak}`:

```aiken
fn get_name(user: User) -> ByteArray {
  when user is {
    LoggedIn { username } -> username
    Guest -> "Guest user"
  }
}
```

The `when *expr* is{:ak}` block forces us to exhaustively handle every
constructor in the type definition.

#### Wildcard

Patterns always need to be complete, but enumerating every single fields or
constructor can sometime be cumbersome. For these situations, Aiken allows the
use of wildcards.

A wildcard is like a fallback pattern, denoted `_{:ak}` and it can be used in place
of a pattern to match any remaining patterns. For example:

```aiken
fn get_name(user: User) -> ByteArray {
  when user is {
    LoggedIn { username } -> username
    _ -> "Guest user"
  }
}
```

Note that wildcards can also be named. And generally speaking, any identifier
that starts with an underscore `_{:ak}` will be treated as a wildcard.

Beware though that wildcards are usually not recommended because they make code
more brittle. Indeed, if you were to add a new constructor to the type `User`,
this function would generate no warnings or errors at compilation because the
wildcard `_` would swallow all the remaining constructors. Yet, imagine the following:

```aiken
type User {
  LoggedInAsAdministrator { username: ByteArray }
  LoggedIn { username: ByteArray }
  Guest
}
```

With the wildcard, `get_name` would compile just fine and return `"Guest user"`
for users logged in as administrator! So, use wildcard only when you cannot do
otherwise. In many situations, it is better to list all patterns explicitly.

<Callout type="info">
  Wildcards also works when destructuring, should you need to only bring
  specific fields in scope but not all.

  ```aiken
  let Dog(name, _cuteness, _age) = dog

  // equivalent to

  let name = dog.name
  ```
</Callout>

#### Alternative patterns

To avoid repeating the same bits of logic across multiple branches, Aiken
provides a syntax for handling multiple patterns at once using the pipe symbol
`|{:ak}`. This works particularly well when patterns introduce the same
identifiers with the same respective types in scope.

```aiken
fn get_name(user: User) -> ByteArray {
  when user is {
    LoggedInAsAdministrator { username } | LoggedIn { username } -> username
    Guest -> "Guest user"
  }
}
```

#### Spread operator

In a similar fashion, it is sometimes useful to pull only specific named fields
out of a constructor or even, none at all. For these situations, Aiken provides
the spread operator `..{:ak}` as a way to indicates that anything else is ignored.

For example, let's pretend we added a field `age: Int` to our `LoggedIn`
constructor variant.

```aiken
fn is_authorized(user: User) -> Bool {
  when user is {
    LoggedInAsAdministrator { .. } -> True
    LoggedIn { days_of_activity, .. } -> days_of_activity > 30
    Guest -> False
  }
}
```

In the function above, you can see how we authorize any administrator or any
logged-in user so long as they have at least 30 days of activity. The spread
operator is used to indicate that other named fields of the records are
ignored.

<Callout type="info">
  The spread operator also works for destructuring, should you need to only bring
  specific fields in scope but not all.

  ```aiken
  let Dog { name, .. } = dog

  // equivalent to

  let name = dog.name
  ```
</Callout>

#### List

Pattern-matching also works on lists with a syntax of their own. In Aiken,
lists are linked-lists, so they are virtually equivalent to a custom-type with
two constructors: either it is an empty list, or it is a value and another
list, possibly empty.

When matching on lists, one may use wildcard and spread operators. Yet in the
case of lists, the spread operator can be named to explicitly capture the tail
of the list. Let's walk through some examples:

```aiken
fn get_head(xs: List<a>) -> Option<a> {
  when xs is {
    [] -> None
    [a, ..] -> Some(a)
  }
}

fn is_empty(xs: List<a>) -> Bool {
  when xs is {
    [] -> True
    [_, ..] -> False
  }
}

fn get_tail(xs: List<a>) -> List<a> {
  when xs is {
    [] -> [] // debatable
    [_, ..tail] -> tail
  }
}
```

#### Nested patterns

Patterns aren't limited to the first level of a type structure only. It is
possible to pattern any compound type as deep as necessary.

```aiken
fn get_name_with_default(dog: Option<Dog>, default: ByteArray) -> ByteArray {
  when dog is {
    Some(Dog { name, .. }) -> name
    _ -> default
  }
}
```

#### Assigning names to sub-patterns

Sometimes when pattern-matching we want to assign a name to a value while
specifying its shape at the same time. We can do this using the `as{:ak}`
keyword.

```aiken
when xs is {
  [[_, ..] as inner_list] -> inner_list
  _other -> []
}
```

## Updating custom types

Aiken provides a dedicated syntax for updating some of the fields of a custom
type record.

```aiken
type Person {
  name: ByteArray,
  shoe_size: Int,
  age: Int,
  is_happy: Bool,
}

fn have_birthday(person) {
  // It's this person's birthday, so increment their age and
  // make them happy
  Person { ..person, age: person.age + 1, is_happy: True }
}
```

The update syntax created a new record with the values of the initial record.
It replaces the given binding with their new values.

## Relationship with Data

At runtime custom types become an opaque Plutus' Data. In Aiken's type system
`Data` matches with any user-defined type (but with none of the primitive
types).

### Upcasting

Thus, it's also possible to cast any custom type **into** `Data{:ak}` (a.k.a
_upcasting_). This implicit conversion is handy for interacting with builtin
functions that operate on raw `Data{:ak}`. Any function that accepts
`Data{:ak}` will automatically work with any custom type.

```aiken
type Datum {
  count: Int,
}

let datum: Datum = Datum { count: 1 }

// fn(Data) -> ByteArray
builtin.serialise_data(datum)

// Or similarly, by providing an annotation.
let as_data: Data = datum
```

### Downcasting

Extracting **from** `Data{:ak}` into a custom type (a.k.a _downcasting_)
however requires the use of [`expect{:ak}`](./control-flow#expect) or an [`if
*pattern* is{:ak}`](./control-flow#if-is) as explained in the [next section:
Control Flow](./control-flow).

While upcasting is always possible and safe, downcasting is not and can fail. How one chooses to handle failure drives the choice between `expect{:ak}` (fail immediately and loudly) and `if/is{:ak}` (fallback gracefully).

In summary:

| From              | To                | Crash on failure?  | How                                            |
| ---               | ---               | ---                | ---                                            |
| _any custom type_ | `Data{:ak}`       | \- _(cannot fail)_ | let-binding + type-annotation                  |
| `Data{:ak}`       | _any custom type_ | no                 | [`if *pattern* is{:ak}`](./control-flow#if-is) |
| `Data{:ak}`       | _any custom type_ | yes                | [`expect{:ak}`](./control-flow#expect)         |

## Type aliases

Finally, it is also possible to define mere aliases for types. A type alias lets
you create a name that is identical to another type, without any additional
information.

```aiken
type MyNumber = Int
```

Aliases are fully interchangeable and bear no difference at runtime. They are
most useful for simplifying type signatures.

```aiken
type Person = (String, Int)

fn create_person(name: String, age: Int) -> Person {
  (name, age)
}
```

<Callout type="info">
While they are fully erased at runtime, type-aliases information are preserved during type-checking and when generating the validator(s) final blueprint(s). Said differently, type aliases will appear in error messages and generated documentation as well.
</Callout>

## Documentation

You may add user-facing documentation to any data-type definition and
constructor with a documentation comment starting with `///{:ak}`. Markdown is
supported and this text will be included with the module's entry in generated
HTML documentation.

```aiken
/// A **incredibly useful** comment to tell you that this type represents: a person.
type Person {
  /// The number of years elapsed since birth.
  age: Int,
  /// The word other people shout to catch this person's attention
  name: String,
}
```

<Callout type="info">
When exported as module documentation, types-definition are alphabetically sorted (in ascending order).
</Callout>
