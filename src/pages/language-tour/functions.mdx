# Functions

## Named functions

Named functions in Aiken are defined using the `fn` keyword. Functions can have (typed) arguments, and always have a return type. Because in Aiken, pretty much everything is an expression, functions do not have an explicit _return_ keyword. Instead, they implicitly return whatever they evaluate to.

```aiken
fn add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
  x + y
}

fn multiply(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
  x * y
}
```

Functions are first class values and so can be assigned to variables, passed to
other functions, or anything else you might do with any other data type.

```aiken
/// This function takes a function as an argument
fn twice(f: fn(t) -> t, x: t) -> t {
  f(f(x))
}

fn add_one(x: Int) -> Int {
  x + 1
}

fn add_two(x: Int) -> Int {
  twice(add_one, x)
}
```

## Anonymous functions

Anonymous functions can be defined with a similar syntax.

```aiken
fn run() {
  let add = fn(x, y) { x + y }

  add(1, 2)
}
```

## Labeled arguments

When functions take several arguments it can be difficult for the user to
remember what the arguments are, and what order they are expected in.

To help with this Aiken supports _labeled arguments_, where function arguments
are given by labels instead of position.

Take this function that replaces sections of a string:

```aiken
fn replace(self: String, pattern: String, replacement: String) {
  // ...
}
```

When calling the function, it is possible to use the defined labels to pass the
arguments:

```aiken
replace(self: "A,B,C", pattern: ",", replacement: " ")

// Labeled arguments can be given in any order
replace(pattern: ",", replacement: " ", self: "A,B,C")

// Positional arguments and labels can be mixed
replace("A,B,C", pattern: ",", replacement: " ")
```

The use of argument labels can allow a function to be called in an expressive,
sentence-like manner, while still providing a function body that is readable
and clear in intent.

### Overriding default labels

Note that, when defining a function, it is possible to override the default
label to use different names (e.g. a shorter name) in the function body. For
example:

```aiken
fn insert(self: List<(String, Int)>, key k: String, value v: Int) {
  // ... do something with `k` and `v`
}
```

Externally, the function can still be called using `key` and `value` as
labelled, but in the function body, they are named `k` and `v` for conciseness.

## Validators

In Aiken, you can promote some functions to _validators_ using the keyword
`validator`.

```ak
validator {
  fn foo(redeemer: Data, script_context: Data) {
    ..
  }

  fn bar(datum: Data, redeemer: Data, script_context: Data) {
    ..
  }
}
```

Functions present in a `validator` block must abide by the following rules:

- [x] They must have exactly 2 or 3 arguments.
- [x] They must be named
- [x] There may be one or two functions, in a single block, but no more.

### Parameters

Validators themselves can take _parameters_, which represent configuration
elements that must be provided to create an instance of the validator. Once
provided, parameters are embedded within the compiled validator and part of the
generated code. Hence they must be provided before any address can be
calculated for the corresponding validator.

```ak
validator(utxo_ref: ByteArray) {
  fn foo(redeemer: Data, script_context: Data) {
    ..
  }
}
```

We see more examples of validators in the examples presented later in this user
manual.

## Pipe Operator

Aiken provides syntax for passing the result of one function to the arguments
of another function, the pipe operator (`|>`). This is similar in functionality
to the same operator in Elixir or F#.

The pipe operator allows you to chain function calls without using a lot of
parenthesis and nesting. For a simple example, consider the following
implementation of an imaginary `string.reverse` in Aiken:

```aiken
string_builder.to_string(string_builder.reverse(string_builder.from_string(string)))
```

This can be expressed more naturally using the pipe operator, eliminating the
need to track parenthesis closure.

```aiken
string
|> string_builder.from_string
|> string_builder.reverse
|> string_builder.to_string
```

Each line of this expression applies the function to the result of the previous
line. This works easily because each of these functions takes only one
argument. Syntax is available to substitute specific arguments of functions
that take more than one argument; for more, look below in the section "Function
capturing".

## Function capturing

There is a shorthand syntax for creating anonymous functions that take one
argument and call another function. The `_` is used to indicate where the
argument should be passed.

```aiken
fn add(x, y) {
  x + y
}

fn run() {
  let add_one = add(1, _)

  add_one(2)
}
```

The function capture syntax is often used with the pipe operator to create
a series of transformations on some data.

```aiken
fn add(x: Int , y: Int ) -> Int {
  x + y
}

fn run() {
  // This is the same as add(add(add(1, 3), 6), 9)
  1
  |> add(_, 3)
  |> add(_, 6)
  |> add(_, 9)
}
```

In fact, this usage is so common that there is a special shorthand for it.

```aiken
fn run() {
  // This is the same as the example above
  1
  |> add(3)
  |> add(6)
  |> add(9)
}
```

The pipe operator will first check to see if the left hand value could be used
as the first argument to the call, e.g. `a |> b(1, 2)` would become `b(a, 1, 2)`.

If not it falls back to calling the result of the right hand side as a function
, e.g. `b(1, 2)(a)`.

## Backpassing `←`

Functions that take a continuation (i.e. callback with a single argument) can be invoked using the backpassing syntax:

```aiken
let x <- foo()

// which is equivalent to writing:

foo(fn(x) {

})
```

This is particularly well suited for functions that operate over abstractions
such as `Option` or `Fuzzer` and that provide an API of primitives to
manipulate them. For example, let's consider the following small API over a
`Fuzzer`:

```aiken
fn constant(a) -> Fuzzer<a>
fn bool() -> Fuzzer<Bool>
fn map(Fuzzer<a>, fn(a) -> b) -> Fuzzer<b>
fn and_then(Fuzzer<a>, fn(a) -> Fuzzer<b>) -> Fuzzer<b>
```

And let's look at an excerpt constructing a pipeline using those primitives _without backpassing_. Something along the lines of:

```aiken
pub fn option(fuzz_a: Fuzzer<a>) -> Fuzzer<Option<a>> {
  bool()
    |> and_then(
         fn(predicate) {
           if predicate {
             fuzz_a |> map(Some)
           } else {
             constant(None)
           }
         },
       )
}
```

A bit involved, isn't it? Here we can see how `and_then` is used to step through the bool's `Fuzzer`. This can be re-written more simply with backpassing as:

```aiken
pub fn option(fuzz_a: Fuzzer<a>) -> Fuzzer<Option<a>> {
  let predicate <- and_then(bool())
  if predicate {
   fuzz_a |> map(Some)
  } else {
    constant(None)
  }
}
```

Which reads a lot better! In fact, this technique becomes even more useful when there's a lot of nested callbacks as it _flattens_ them into a sequence of backpassed let-bindings.

## Generic functions

At times you may wish to write functions that are generic over multiple types.
For example, consider a function that consumes any value and returns a list
containing two of the value that was passed in. This can be expressed in Aiken
like this:

```aiken
fn list_of_two(my_value: a) -> List<a> {
  [my_value, my_value]
}
```

Here the type variable `a` is used to represent any possible type.

You can use any number of different type variables in the same function. This
function declares type variables `a` and `b`.

```aiken
fn multi_result(x: a, y: b, condition: Bool) -> Result<a, b> {
  when condition is {
    True -> Ok(x)
    False -> Error(y)
  }
}
```

Type variables can be named anything and may contain underscores (_), but the names must be lowercase. Like other type annotations, they are completely optional,
but using them may make it easier to understand the code.

## Type annotations

Function arguments are normally annotated with their type, and the
compiler will check these annotations and ensure they are correct.

```aiken
fn identity(x: some_type) -> some_type {
  x
}

fn inferred_identity(x) {
  x
}
```

The Aiken compiler can infer all the types of Aiken code without annotations
and both annotated and unannotated code is equally safe. It's considered a
best practice to always write type annotations for your functions as they
provide useful documentation, and they encourage thinking about types as code
is being written.


## Documentation

You may add user facing documentation in front of function definitions with a
documentation comment `///` per line. Markdown is supported and this text
will be included with the module's entry in generated HTML documentation.

```aiken
/// Always true.
///
fn always_true(_a) -> Bool {
  True
}
```
