# Control flow

## Blocks

Every block in Aiken is an expression. All expressions in the block are
executed, and the result of the last expression is returned.

```aiken
let value: Bool = {
    "Hello"
    42 + 12
    False
}

value == False
```

Expression blocks can be used instead of parenthesis to change the precedence of operations.

```aiken
let celsius = { fahrenheit - 32 } * 5 / 9
```

## Matching

The `when *expr* is` expression is the most common kind of flow control in Aiken code. It
allows us to say "if the data has this shape then do that", which we call
_pattern matching_.

Here we match on an `Int` and return a specific string for the values 0, 1,
and 2. The final pattern `n` matches any other value that did not match any of
the previous patterns.

```aiken
when some_number is {
  0 -> "Zero"
  1 -> "One"
  2 -> "Two"
  n -> "Some other number" // This matches anything
}
```

Aiken's `when *expr* is` is an expression, meaning it returns a value and can be used
anywhere we would use a value. For example, we can name the value evaluated from a _when expression_ with a `let` binding.

```aiken
type Answer {
  Yes
  No
}

let answer = Yes

let description =
  when answer is {
    Yes -> "It's true!"
    No -> "It's not yes."
  }

description == "It's true!"
```

### If-Else

Pattern matching on a `Bool` value is discouraged and `if / else`
expressions should be use instead.

```aiken
let some_bool = True

if some_bool {
  "It's true!"
} else {
  "It's not true."
}
```

Note that, while it may look like an imperative instruction: if this then do
that or else do that, it is in fact one single expression. This means, in
particular, that the return types of both branches have to match.

Incidentally, you can have as many conditional `else/if` branches as you need:

```aiken
fn fibonacci(n: Int) -> Int {
  if n == 0 {
    0
  } else if n == 1 {
    1
  } else {
    fibonacci(n-2) + fibonacci(n-1)
  }
}
```

### Destructuring

A `when *expr* is` expression can be used to destructure values that
contain other values, such as tuples and lists.

```aiken
when xs is {
  [] -> "This list is empty"
  [a] -> "This list has 1 element"
  [a, b] -> "This list has 2 elements"
  _other -> "This list has more than 2 elements"
}
```

It's not just the top level data structure that can be pattern matched,
contained values can also be matched. This gives `when` the ability to
concisely express flow control that might be verbose without pattern matching.

```aiken
when xs is {
  [[]] -> "The only element is an empty list"
  [[], ..] -> "The 1st element is an empty list"
  [[4], ..] -> "The 1st element is a list of the number 4"
  other -> "Something else"
}
```

### Matching single-variant constructors

Aiken lets you pattern match on values from types that have a single
constructor using a `let`-binding directly. This is the case for any `Tuple`
, for example, or any custom type with a single constructor.

```aiken
type Foo {
  foo: Int
}

let (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3)
let Foo { foo } = Foo { foo: 42 }
```

### Assigning names to sub-patterns

Sometimes when pattern matching we want to assign a name to a value while
specifying its shape at the same time. We can do this using the `as` keyword.

```aiken
when xs is {
  [[_, ..] as inner_list] -> inner_list
  _other -> []
}
```

## Error & Todo

Sometimes, you need to halt the evaluation of your program because you've
reached a case that is considered invalid or simply because you haven't yet
finished developing some logic. Aiken provides two convenient keywords for
that: `fail` and `todo`.

When encountered, both will halt the evaluation of your program which will be
considered failed. They differ in their semantic i.e. how the compiler
behaves towards them.

In fact, `todo` will trigger warnings at compilation to remind you of those
unfinished parts. `fail` will not, as it is assumed to be a desired break
point. Note that the warning also includes the expected type of the expression
that needs to replace the `todo`. This can be a useful way of asking the
compiler what type is needed if you are ever unsure.

Let's see an example for both to grasp the difference:

```aiken
fn favourite_number() -> Int {
  // The type annotations says this returns an Int, but we don't need
  // to implement it yet.
  todo
}

fn expect_some_value(opt: Option<a>) -> a {
  when opt is {
    Some(a) -> a
    None -> fail // We want this to fail when we encounter 'None'.
  }
}
```

When this code is built Aiken will type check and compile the code to ensure it
is valid, and the `todo` or `fail` will be replaced with code that crashes the
program if that function is run.

### Giving a reason

A `String` message can be given as a form of documentation. The message will be
traced when the `todo` or `fail` code is evaluated. Note that this is likely
the only place where you will encounter the type `String` and this is because
the message needs to be printable -- unlike most `ByteArray` which are often
plain gibberish.

```aiken
fn favourite_number() -> Int {
  todo @"Believe in the you that believes in yourself!"
}

fn expect_some_value(opt: Option<a>) -> a {
  when opt is {
    Some(a) -> a
    None -> fail @"Option has no value"
  }
}
```
