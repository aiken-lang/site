# Getting started

## Creating a new project

Use `aiken new` to create a scaffold a new project and follow instructions from
the generated `README.md` at the root of your project. On success, your project
should look roughly as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── aiken.toml
├── lib
│   └── foo
└── validators
```

## Compiling a project

Use `aiken build` to compile a project, and `aiken check` to only type-check a
project and run tests.

If you're writing a library `aiken docs` is a powerful utility to generate HTML
documentation from types, type annotations and comments. Abuse it!

Finally, once compiled, you may look at the `aiken blueprint` command group to
generate addresses, apply parameters and convert the build output to various
formats.

## Project structure

### Folder organisation

Aiken projects divide their source code in two categories: library code, and
application code. Library code must be located in a `lib` folder, and
application code (i.e. on-chain validators) located in a `validators` folder.

After compilation, the compiler will generate a Plutus blueprint
(`plutus.json`), which is an interoperable document that summarizes your
project. The blueprint also contains compiled code for each validator of your
project and their corresponding hash digests to be used in addresses.

### Configuration

A project has a top-level `aiken.toml` file at its root containing metadata
about the projects, as well as dependencies required by it. Here's a sample of
(documented) project configuration:

```toml filename="aiken.toml"
# Project's name, as {organisation}/{project}
name = "acme/foo"

# Project's version, we recommend semantic versioning for libraries
version = "1.0.0"

# One or more license(s); we recommend Apache-2.0 or MPL-2.0 for open source
# projects.
licences = ["Apache-2.0"]

# An informative albeit short description of the project.
description = "A next-level DeFi platform"

# Optional section, gives additional structured information on a project to
# show in generated documentation.
[repository]
platform = "github"   # Platform type, `github`, `gitlab` or `bitbucket`
user = "aiken-lang"   # Username or organisation on that platform
project = "stdlib"    # Repository or project on that platform

# A list of dependencies
#
# Leave as:
#
#     dependencies = []
#
# If you have none.
#
# Avoid editing by hand, use `aiken packages` to manage them.
[[dependencies]]
name = "aiken-lang/stdlib"   # Project's name
version = "main"             # Version, as a branch or git commit hash
source = "github"            # Platform type, `github`, `gitlab` or `bitbucket`
```

## Well-known packages & modules

### Aiken's prelude

The `prelude` contains a minimum set of functions, constructors and modules
available _by default_ to all Aiken projects. You can find it on
[aiken-lang/prelude](https://aiken-lang.github.io/prelude/) and at the bottom
of this website.

### Aiken's standard library

The standard library (or `stdlib` in short) gathers useful functions and
data-structures that might come in handy in your Aiken programming journey.
It's also a good reference of well-written and well-tested Aiken code if you
need some examples to get started with. You can find it on
[aiken-lang/stdlib](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/) and at the bottom of
this website.
