# About

## Team

Aiken is currently maintained by [Lucas Rosa](https://github.com/rvcas), [Kasey White](https://github.com/MicroProofs) and [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/KtorZ). You can check out the full list of contributors on [GitHub](https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken/graphs/contributors).

The [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/) supports the project by fueling its development with engineering resources. It is also one of the first pioneer to experiment with Aiken and use it for projects internally.

[TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/) has been Aiken's original home, and still provides great support to the project as well as a room for discussion on their Discord server. Besides, TxPipe developed [Pallas](https://github.com/txpipe/pallas) -- Rust-native building blocks for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem -- which Aiken uses internally for some features. Through their platform [demeter.run](https://demeter.run/) they also provide infrastructure and streamlined access to Aiken.

### Louis Pilfold

A substantial part of Aiken was forked from [the Gleam language](https://gleam.run/) made and maintained by Louis Pilfold. We are thankful for the love he's put into Gleam and are delighted to build on top of his excellent work.
