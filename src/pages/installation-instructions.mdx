# Installation Instructions

## Compiler & toolkit

### From `aikup`

First, install `aikup`: a basic utility tool to download and manage Aiken's
pre-compiled executables:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://install.aiken-lang.org | bash
```

Then, simply run:

```
aikup
```

<Callout type="info">
  `aikup` alone installs the latest version available. You can install specific versions
  by specifying a version number. For usage instructions, use `aikup --help`.
</Callout>

### From sources

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken.git
```

<Callout type="info">
  `cargo` is a package manager for Rust. To install it, please refer to [the
  Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
</Callout>

### From Nix flakes

```sh
nix build github:aiken-lang/aiken#aiken
```

## Language Server

The `aiken` command-line comes with a built-in [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). If needed, configure your language client with the following configuration (refer to your language client's instructions):

- command: `aiken lsp` (the command is hidden from the command-line help usage)
- root pattern: `aiken.toml`
- filetype: aiken (`.ak`)
