# Vesting

Armed with our recently acquired knowledge from the _Hello, World!_ contract,
let's increase the difficulty and write a slightly more challenging one.

A vesting contract is a common type of contract that allows to lock funds for a
period of time, only to unlock them later -- once a specified time has passed.
Usually, vesting contract defines a beneficiary who can be different from the
original owner.

## Setup

In a similar fashion to what we did for the _Hello, World!_ contract, we'll
need some credentials (and funds) to play around with. Here, we define an extra
key for the beneficiary. Again, use the [Cardano
faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet) to receive test
funds. Refer to [Hello, World! :: Getting
Funds](/example--hello-world/end-to-end/lucid#getting-funds) in case you have any doubts
on the procedure.

```js filename="generate-credentials.mjs"
import { MeshWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';
import fs from 'node:fs';

// Generate secret keys for both wallets
const owner_secret_key = MeshWallet.brew(true);
const beneficiary_secret_key = MeshWallet.brew(true);

// Initialize the owner wallet with the generated secret key
const owner_wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0,
  key: {
    type: 'root',
    bech32: owner_secret_key,
  },
});

// Initialize the beneficiary wallet with its secret key, using the same setup
const beneficiary_wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0,
  key: {
    type: 'root',
    bech32: beneficiary_secret_key,
  },
});

// save keys to files
fs.writeFileSync('owner.sk', owner_secret_key);
fs.writeFileSync('beneficiary.sk', beneficiary_secret_key);

// Save unused addresses to files 
fs.writeFileSync('owner.addr', owner_wallet.getUnusedAddresses()[0]);
fs.writeFileSync('beneficiary.addr', beneficiary_wallet.getUnusedAddresses()[0]);
</Callout>


## On-Chain code

Let's write our time lock validator as `validators/vesting.ak`, starting with
the definition of its interface (i.e. its datum's shape).

```aiken filename="validators/vesting.ak"
use aiken/hash.{Blake2b_224, Hash}
use aiken/transaction/credential.{VerificationKey}

type Datum {
  /// POSIX time in millisecond, e.g. 1672843961000
  lock_until: POSIXTime,
  /// Owner's credentials
  owner: VerificationKeyHash,
  /// Beneficiary's credentials
  beneficiary: VerificationKeyHash,
}

type VerificationKeyHash =
  Hash<Blake2b_224, VerificationKey>

type POSIXTime =
  Int
```

As we can see the script's datum serves as configuration and contains the
different parameters of our vesting operation. Remember that these elements are
set when locking funds in the contract; combined with the script they define
the conditions by which the funds can be released.

From there, lets define the `spend` validator itself.

```aiken filename="validators/vesting.ak"
use aiken/interval.{Finite}
use aiken/list
use aiken/transaction.{Transaction, ScriptContext, Spend, ValidityRange}

validator {
  fn vesting(datum: Datum, _redeemer: Void, ctx: ScriptContext) {
    // In principle, scripts can be used for different purpose (e.g. minting
    // assets). Here we make sure it's only used when 'spending' from a eUTxO
    when ctx.purpose is {
      Spend(_) ->
        or {
          must_be_signed_by(ctx.transaction, datum.owner),
          and {
            must_be_signed_by(ctx.transaction, datum.beneficiary),
            must_start_after(ctx.transaction.validity_range, datum.lock_until),
          },
        }
      _ -> False
    }
  }
}

fn must_be_signed_by(transaction: Transaction, vk: VerificationKeyHash) {
  list.has(transaction.extra_signatories, vk)
}

fn must_start_after(range: ValidityRange, lock_expiration_time: POSIXTime) {
  when range.lower_bound.bound_type is {
    Finite(tx_earliest_time) -> lock_expiration_time <= tx_earliest_time
    _ -> False
  }
}
```

The novelty here mostly lies in the check against a time period. In fact,
transactions can have validity intervals that define from when and until when
the transaction is considered valid. Validity bounds are checked by the ledger
prior to executing a script and only does so if the bounds are legit.

This is meant to give scripts a notion of time, while preserving determinism
from within the context of a script. For example, in this scenario, given a
lower bound `A` on the transaction, we can deduce that the current time is _at
least_ `A`.

Note that because we don't control the upper-bound, it could very much be that
this transaction is executed 30 years after the vesting delay. Yet, from the
perspective of the vesting script, this is perfectly okay.

See also how we annotate the redeemer to `Void` to indicate that it isn't used.
We could also leave it unannotated but it's generally good to signal your intent
explicitly. `Void` captures that pretty well.

### Testing

Okay, now before deploying our contract in the wild and risking collapsing the
economy with some unforeseen bug, let's write a few tests. Aiken has builtin
support for tests, which are very much like functions that takes no argument
and must return a `Bool{:ak}`.

Tests can use any function, constant or types defines in our module but beware,
they cannot reference other tests!

```aiken filename="validators/vesting.ak"
use aiken/interval.{Finite, Interval, IntervalBound, PositiveInfinity}

test must_start_after_succeed_when_lower_bound_is_after() {
  must_start_after(interval.after(2), 1)
}

test must_start_after_succeed_when_lower_bound_is_equal() {
  must_start_after(interval.after(2), 2)
}

test must_start_after_fail_when_lower_bound_is_before() {
  !must_start_after(interval.after(2), 3)
}
```

<Callout>
  You can run tests with `aiken check`; Aiken will collect and run all tests
  found in your modules, and give you some statistics about the execution units
  (CPU and memory) required by the test.
</Callout>

### Building

It's now time to build our on-chain contract! Simply do:

```
aiken build
```

This generate a [CIP-0057 Plutus blueprint](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/258) as `plutus.json` at the root of your project. This blueprint describes your on-chain contract and its binary interface. In particular, it contains the generated on-chain code that will be executed by the ledger, and a hash of your validator(s) that can be used to construct addresses.

Let's see the validator in action!

## Off-Chain code

As a starter, we need to lock funds in our newly created contract. We'll use
[`Lucid`](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid) to construct and submit our
transaction through Blockfrost.

<Callout type="info">
  This is only one example of possible setup using tools we love. For more
  tools, make sure to check out the [Cardano Developer
  Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/tools)!
</Callout>

### Setup

First, we setup Lucid with Blockfrost as a provider. You know the drill from
the [_Hello, World!_](/getting-started/hello-world) example already.

```ts filename="vesting_lock.ts"
import {
  Blockfrost,
  C,
  Data,
  Lucid,
  SpendingValidator,
  TxHash,
  fromHex,
  toHex,
} from "https://deno.land/x/lucid@0.8.3/mod.ts";
import * as cbor from "https://deno.land/x/cbor@v1.4.1/index.js";

const lucid = await Lucid.new(
  new Blockfrost(
    "https://cardano-preview.blockfrost.io/api/v0",
    Deno.env.get("BLOCKFROST_API_KEY"),
  ),
  "Preview",
);

lucid.selectWalletFromPrivateKey(await Deno.readTextFile("./owner.sk"));

const validator = await readValidator();

// --- Supporting functions

async function readValidator(): Promise<SpendingValidator> {
  const validator = JSON.parse(await Deno.readTextFile("plutus.json")).validators[0];
  return {
    type: "PlutusV2",
    script: toHex(cbor.encode(fromHex(validator.compiledCode))),
  };
}
```

<Callout>
  If you've installed [deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.1/getting_started/installation), you can run the except above by executing:

```
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env vesting_lock.ts
```

It assumes that this file (`vesting_lock.ts`) is placed at the root of your `vesting` folder. At this stage, your folder should looks roughly like this:

```
./vesting
│
├── README.md
├── aiken.toml
├── plutus.json
├── vesting_lock.ts
├── owner.addr
├── owner.sk
├── beneficiary.addr
├── beneficiary.sk
├── lib
│   └── ...
└── validators
    └── vesting.ak
```

</Callout>

### Locking funds into the contract

Here, we make our first transaction to lock funds into the contract. The datum
must match the representation expected by the script, constructor is an object expecting 3 fields.

```ts filename="vesting_lock.ts"
const ownerPublicKeyHash = lucid.utils.getAddressDetails(
  await lucid.wallet.address()
).paymentCredential.hash;

const beneficiaryPublicKeyHash =
  lucid.utils.getAddressDetails(await Deno.readTextFile("beneficiary.addr"))
    .paymentCredential.hash;

const Datum = Data.Object({
  lock_until: Data.BigInt, // this is POSIX time, you can check and set it here: https://www.unixtimestamp.com
  owner: Data.String, // we can pass owner's verification key hash as byte array but also as a string
  beneficiary: Data.String, // we can beneficiary's hash as byte array but also as a string
});

type Datum = Data.Static<typeof Datum>;

const datum = Data.to<Datum>(
  {
    lock_until: 1672843961000n, // Wed Jan 04 2023 14:52:41 GMT+0000
    owner: ownerPublicKeyHash, // our own wallet verification key hash
    beneficiary: beneficiaryPublicKeyHash,
  },
  Datum
);

const txLock = await lock(1000000, { into: validator, datum: datum });

await lucid.awaitTx(txLock);

console.log(`1 tADA locked into the contract
    Tx ID: ${txLock}
    Datum: ${datum}
`);

// --- Supporting functions

async function lock(lovelace, { into, datum }): Promise<TxHash> {
  const contractAddress = lucid.utils.validatorToAddress(into);

  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .payToContract(contractAddress, { inline: datum }, { lovelace })
    .complete();

  const signedTx = await tx.sign().complete();

  return signedTx.submit();
}
```

### Unlocking funds from the contract

Now we can use another wallet (beneficiary.sk). This wallet will be beneficiary
wallet had been added into datum in the previous step (locking) as well.

Finally, as a last step: we now want to spend the UTxO that is locked by our
`vesting` contract.

To be valid, our transaction must meet one of two conditions:

- it must be signed by the owner referenced as "owner" in the datum; or
- it must be signed by the beneficiary referenced as "beneficiary" in the datum
  AND time has to pass beyond the threshold we fixed -- that is it needs to be
  later than 'Wed Jan 04 2023 14:52:41 GMT+0000'.

Like for the _Hello, World!_ example, we need to explicitly add a signer using
`.addSigner` so that it gets added to the `extra_signatories` of our
transaction and becomes accessible for our script.

In addition we need to specify `.validFrom` as a POSIX timestamp from where
transaction is considered valid (should be by the time we submit it). We can
optionally defined an upper validity bound using `.validTo` as a TTL
(Time-To-Live).

Let's make a new file `vesting_unlock.ts` and copy over some of the boilerplate
from the first one.

```ts filename="vesting_unlock.ts"
import {
  Blockfrost,
  C,
  Data,
  Lucid,
  SpendingValidator,
  TxHash,
  fromHex,
  toHex,
} from "https://deno.land/x/lucid@0.8.3/mod.ts";
import * as cbor from "https://deno.land/x/cbor@v1.4.1/index.js";

const lucid = await Lucid.new(
  new Blockfrost(
    "https://cardano-preview.blockfrost.io/api/v0",
    Deno.env.get("BLOCKFROST_API_KEY"),
  ),
  "Preview",
);

lucid.selectWalletFromPrivateKey(await Deno.readTextFile("./beneficiary.sk"));

const beneficiaryPublicKeyHash = lucid.utils.getAddressDetails(
  await lucid.wallet.address()
).paymentCredential.hash;

const validator = await readValidator();

// --- Supporting functions

async function readValidator(): Promise<SpendingValidator> {
  const validator = JSON.parse(await Deno.readTextFile("plutus.json")).validators[0];
  return {
    type: "PlutusV2",
    script: toHex(cbor.encode(fromHex(validator.compiledCode))),
  };
}
```

Now, let's add the bits to unlock the funds in the contract. We'll need the
transaction identifier obtained when you ran the previous script
(`vesting_lock.ts`)

That transaction identifier, and the corresponding output index (here, `0`)
uniquely identifies the UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) in which the funds
are currently locked. And that's the one we're about to unlock.

As we stated above, we need to make sure to only submit our transaction after
the vesting delay has passed without what the node will simply reject the
transaction (without charging any fee) and kindly ask us to re-submit the
transaction at a later time.

```ts filename="vesting_unlock.ts"
// ^^^ Code above is unchanged. ^^^

const scriptAddress = lucid.utils.validatorToAddress(validator);

// we get all the UTXOs sitting at the script address
const scriptUtxos = await lucid.utxosAt(scriptAddress);

const Datum = Data.Object({
  lock_until: Data.BigInt, // this is POSIX time, you can check and set it here: https://www.unixtimestamp.com
  owner: Data.String, // we can pass owner's verification key hash as byte array but also as a string
  beneficiary: Data.String, // we can beneficiary's hash as byte array but also as a string
});

type Datum = Data.Static<typeof Datum>;

const currentTime = new Date().getTime();

// we filter out all the UTXOs by beneficiary and lock_until
const utxos = scriptUtxos.filter((utxo) => {
    let datum = Data.from<Datum>(
      utxo.datum,
      Datum,
    );

    return datum.beneficiary === beneficiaryPublicKeyHash &&
      datum.lock_until <= currentTime;
});

if (utxos.length === 0) {
  console.log("No redeemable utxo found. You need to wait a little longer...");
  Deno.exit(1);
}

// we don't have any redeemer in our contract but it needs to be empty
const redeemer = Data.empty();

const txUnlock = await unlock(utxos, currentTime, { from: validator, using: redeemer });

await lucid.awaitTx(txUnlock);

console.log(`1 tADA recovered from the contract
    Tx ID: ${txUnlock}
    Redeemer: ${redeemer}
`);

// --- Supporting functions

async function unlock(utxos, currentTime, { from, using }): Promise<TxHash> {
  const laterTime = new Date(currentTime + 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000).getTime(); // add two hours (TTL: time to live)

  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .collectFrom(utxos, using)
    .addSigner(await lucid.wallet.address()) // this should be beneficiary address
    .validFrom(currentTime)
    .validTo(laterTime)
    .attachSpendingValidator(from)
    .complete();

  const signedTx = await tx
    .sign()
    .complete();

  return signedTx.submit();
}
```

<Callout>
  As you imagine, we can run this script with the following incantation:

```
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env vesting_unlock.ts
```

</Callout>

Assuming everything went well... congratulations 🎉!
