# Vesting

Armed with our recently acquired knowledge from the _Hello, World!_ contract,
let's increase the difficulty and write a slightly more challenging one.

A vesting contract is a common type of contract that allows funds to be locked for a period of time and unlocked laterâ€”once a specified time has passed. 
Typically, a vesting contract defines a beneficiary who may be different from the original owner.

## Setup

In a similar fashion to what we did for the _Hello, World!_ contract, we'll
need some credentials (and funds) to play around with. Here, we define an extra
key for the beneficiary. Again, use the [Cardano
faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet) to receive test
funds. Refer to [Hello, World! :: Getting
Funds](/example--hello-world/end-to-end/lucid#getting-funds) in case you have any doubts
on the procedure.


```js filename="generate-credentials.mjs"
import fs from 'node:fs';
import {
  MeshWallet,
} from "@meshsdk/core";


// Generate a secret key for the owner wallet and beneficiary wallet
const owner_secret_key = MeshWallet.brew(true);
const beneficiary_secret_key = MeshWallet.brew(true);

//Save secret keys to files
fs.writeFileSync('owner.sk', owner_secret_key);
fs.writeFileSync('beneficiary.sk', beneficiary_secret_key);

const owner_wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0,
  key: {
    type: 'root',
    bech32: owner_secret_key,
  },
});

const beneficiary_wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0,
  key: {
    type: 'root',
    bech32: beneficiary_secret_key,
  },
});

// Save unused addresses to files 
fs.writeFileSync('owner.addr', owner_wallet.getUnusedAddresses()[0]);
fs.writeFileSync('beneficiary.addr', beneficiary_wallet.getUnusedAddresses()[0]);
```
## On-Chain code

Let's write our time lock validator as `validators/vesting.ak`, starting with
the definition of its interface (i.e. its datum's shape).

```aiken filename="validators/vesting.ak"
use aiken/crypto.{VerificationKeyHash}

pub type VestingDatum {
  /// POSIX time in milliseconds, e.g. 1672843961000
  lock_until: Int,
  /// Owner's credentials
  owner: VerificationKeyHash,
  /// Beneficiary's credentials
  beneficiary: VerificationKeyHash,
}
```
## Dependency
An additional dependency we will add to this project is [vodka](https://github.com/sidan-lab/vodka).
To include vodka in our Aiken project, lets update our aiken.toml file to specify it as a dependency.

```aiken filename="aiken.toml"
[[dependencies]]
name = "sidan-lab/vodka"
version = "0.1.1-beta"
source = "github"

```
Using vodka as a dependency provides access to several utility functions designed for common contract validation needs. 
In our vesting.ak file, we will use two specific functions from vodka:

- **`key_signed`**: Verifies that a specific key has signed the transaction. This ensures only authorized users can interact with the contract.

- **`valid_after`**: Checks that a transaction is only valid after a designated time. This is useful for setting time-based constraints within your contract logic.

As we can see the script's datum serves as configuration and contains the
different parameters of our vesting operation. Remember that these elements are
set when locking funds in the contract; combined with the script they define
the conditions by which the funds can be released.

From there, lets define the `spend` validator itself.

```aiken filename="validators/vesting.ak"
use cardano/transaction.{OutputReference, Transaction}
use vodka_extra_signatories.{key_signed}
use vodka_validity_range.{valid_after}
use aiken/crypto.{VerificationKeyHash}

pub type VestingDatum {
  /// POSIX time in milliseconds, e.g. 1672843961000
  lock_until: Int,
  /// Owner's credentials
  owner: VerificationKeyHash,
  /// Beneficiary's credentials
  beneficiary: VerificationKeyHash,
}

validator vesting {
  // In principle, scripts can be used for different purpose (e.g. minting
  // assets). Here we make sure it's only used when 'spending' from a eUTxO
  spend(
    datum_opt: Option<VestingDatum>,
    _redeemer: Data,
    _input: OutputReference,
    tx: Transaction,
  ) {
    expect Some(datum) = datum_opt
    or {
      key_signed(tx.extra_signatories, datum.owner),
      and {
        key_signed(tx.extra_signatories, datum.beneficiary),
        valid_after(tx.validity_range, datum.lock_until),
      },
    }
  }

  else(_) {
    fail
  }
}
```

The key feature here is the time-based check, which is abstracted by 
the valid_after function. In fact, transactions can have validity intervals that define from when
and until the transaction is considered valid. Validity bounds are checked by the ledger
prior to executing a script and only does so if the bounds are legit.

This is meant to give scripts a notion of time, while preserving determinism
from within the context of a script. For example, in this scenario, given a
lower bound `A` on the transaction, we can deduce that the current time is _at
least_ `A`.

Note that because we don't control the upper-bound, it could very much be that
this transaction is executed 30 years after the vesting delay. Yet, from the
perspective of the vesting script, this is perfectly okay.

In Aiken, values that are not used directly can be prefixed with an underscore (`_`)
to indicate they are intentionally ignored. In this validator, `_redeemer` and `_input` 
are marked as unused inputs, making the intent clear and improving readability.  

This practice is particularly helpful in contracts that may require multiple 
parameters for different purposes, such as minting or spending, while not all
parameters are always relevant to the current logic.


### Testing

Okay, now before deploying our contract in the wild and risking collapsing the
economy with some unforeseen bug, let's write a simple test. Aiken has builtin
support for tests, which are very much like functions that takes no argument
and must return a `Bool{:ak}`.

In the test below, we also leverage the **mocktail** module provided by the **vodka** dependency. 
This module offers various utility functions that simplify unit testing for our smart contracts. 


Tests can use any function, constant or types defines in our module but beware,
they cannot reference other tests!

```aiken filename="validators/vesting.ak"

// ^^^ Code above is unchanged. ^^^

// The mocktail module comes from the vodka dependency.
// These dependencies should be added at the top of the file with the other imported modules. 
use mocktail.{complete, invalid_before, mocktail_tx, required_signer_hash}
use mocktail/virgin_key_hash.{mock_pub_key_hash}
use mocktail/virgin_output_reference.{mock_utxo_ref}

type TestCase {
  is_owner_signed: Bool,
  is_beneficiary_signed: Bool,
  is_lock_time_passed: Bool,
}

fn get_test_tx(test_case: TestCase) {
  let TestCase { is_owner_signed, is_beneficiary_signed, is_lock_time_passed } =
    test_case

  mocktail_tx()
    |> required_signer_hash(is_owner_signed, mock_pub_key_hash(1))
    |> required_signer_hash(is_beneficiary_signed, mock_pub_key_hash(2))
    |> invalid_before(is_lock_time_passed, 1672843961001)
    |> complete()
}

fn vesting_datum() {
  VestingDatum {
    lock_until: 1672843961000,
    owner: mock_pub_key_hash(1),
    beneficiary: mock_pub_key_hash(2),
  }
}

test success_unlocking() {
  let output_reference = mock_utxo_ref(0, 1)
  let datum = Some(vesting_datum())
  let test_case =
    TestCase {
      is_owner_signed: True,
      is_beneficiary_signed: True,
      is_lock_time_passed: True,
    }

  let tx = get_test_tx(test_case)
  vesting.spend(datum, Void, output_reference, tx)
}
```

<Callout>
  You can run tests with `aiken check`; Aiken will collect and run all tests
  found in your modules, and give you some statistics about the execution units
  (CPU and memory) required by the test.

### Building

It's now time to build our on-chain contract! Simply do:

```
aiken build
```

This generate a [CIP-0057 Plutus blueprint](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/258) as `plutus.json` at the root of your project. This blueprint describes your on-chain contract and its binary interface. In particular, it contains the generated on-chain code that will be executed by the ledger, and a hash of your validator(s) that can be used to construct addresses.

Let's see the validator in action!

## Off-Chain code

### Setup
First, let's install the dotenv package(https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), which allows us to import our API key from a .env file. Next, we'll create a directory called common and, within it, a file named common.mjs. 
This file will house utility functions used for both locking and unlocking assets. In this setup, we will import our [BLOCKFROST_API](https://blockfrost.dev/overview/getting-started) key from the .env file. 



```js filename="common/common.mjs"
import 'dotenv/config';
import {
  MeshWallet,
  BlockfrostProvider,
  MeshTxBuilder,
  serializePlutusScript,
} from "@meshsdk/core";
import { applyParamsToScript } from "@meshsdk/core-csl";
import fs, { read } from 'fs';


export const blockchainProvider = new BlockfrostProvider(process.env.BLOCKFROST_API);


export const owner_wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0,
  fetcher: blockchainProvider,
  submitter: blockchainProvider,
  key: {
    type: "root",
    bech32: fs.readFileSync("owner.sk").toString(),
  },
});

export const beneficiary_wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0,
  fetcher: blockchainProvider,
  submitter: blockchainProvider,
  key: {
    type: "root",
    bech32: fs.readFileSync("beneficiary.sk").toString(),
  },
});

export function getTxBuilder() {
  return new MeshTxBuilder({
    fetcher: blockchainProvider,
    submitter: blockchainProvider,
  });
}

const blueprint = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./plutus.json"));
export const scriptCbor = applyParamsToScript(blueprint.validators[0].compiledCode, []);
export const scriptAddr = serializePlutusScript(
  { code: scriptCbor, version: "V3" },
  undefined,
  0
).address;


```
### Locking funds into the contract

First, we will set up the depositFundTx function.
This function will encapsulate the core logic for locking funds into the smart contract, ensuring that the deposit process is handled efficiently and securely.

```js filename="vesting_lock.mjs"
import { mConStr0 } from "@meshsdk/common";
import { deserializeAddress } from "@meshsdk/core";
import {
  getTxBuilder,
  owner_wallet,
  beneficiary_wallet,
  scriptAddr,
} from "./common/common.mjs";

async function depositFundTx(amount, lockUntilTimeStampMs) {
  const utxos = await owner_wallet.getUtxos();
  const { pubKeyHash: ownerPubKeyHash } = deserializeAddress(
    owner_wallet.addresses.baseAddressBech32
  );
  const { pubKeyHash: beneficiaryPubKeyHash } = deserializeAddress(
    beneficiary_wallet.addresses.baseAddressBech32
  );

  const txBuilder = getTxBuilder();
  await txBuilder
    .txOut(scriptAddr, amount)
    .txOutInlineDatumValue(
      mConStr0([lockUntilTimeStampMs, ownerPubKeyHash, beneficiaryPubKeyHash])
    )
    .changeAddress(owner_wallet.addresses.baseAddressBech32)
    .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
    .complete();
  return txBuilder.txHex;
}
```

Now that we have built the core logic let's setup the main function that will handle signing and submitting the transaction. 
It will also call depositFundTx with the arguments it expects. 

```js filename="vesting_lock.mjs"

// ^^^ Code above is unchanged. ^^^

async function main() {
  const assets = [
    {
      unit: "lovelace",
      quantity: "3000000",
    },
  ];

  const lockUntilTimeStamp = new Date();
  lockUntilTimeStamp.setMinutes(lockUntilTimeStamp.getMinutes() + 1);

  const unsignedTx = await depositFundTx(assets, lockUntilTimeStamp.getTime());

  const signedTx = await owner_wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
  const txHash = await owner_wallet.submitTx(signedTx);

  //Copy this txHash. You will need this hash in vesting_unlock.mjs
  console.log("txHash", txHash);
}

main();
```

<Callout>
  You can run the instructions above using Node via:
```console
node vesting_lock.mjs
```
</Callout>

If all went according to plan, you should see the transaction identifier in the console.
Make sure you copy this hash, you will need it in vesting_unlock.mjs file. 


### Unlocking funds from the contract

Now want to spend the UTxO that is locked by our
`vesting` contract.

To be valid, our transaction must meet one of two conditions:

- it must be signed by the owner referenced as "owner" in the datum; or
- It must be signed by the beneficiary, who is referenced as "beneficiary" in the datum, and the transaction must occur after a specific time threshold. 
  This threshold is defined as one minute beyond the current time when the lock condition is set.

Let's make a new file `vesting_unlock.ts` and add the bits to unlock the funds in the contract. 
This file contains the function withdrawFundTx, which allows the beneficiary to unlock funds from a vesting contract. 
The function handles the necessary transaction construction and ensures that the funds can only be accessed after the specified conditions are met.

```js filename="vesting_unlock.mjs"
import {
  deserializeAddress,
  deserializeDatum,
  unixTimeToEnclosingSlot,
  SLOT_CONFIG_NETWORK,
} from "@meshsdk/core";

import {
  getTxBuilder,
  beneficiary_wallet,
  scriptAddr,
  scriptCbor,
  blockchainProvider,
} from "./common/common.mjs";

async function withdrawFundTx(vestingUtxo) {
  const utxos = await beneficiary_wallet.getUtxos();
  const beneficiaryAddress = beneficiary_wallet.addresses.baseAddressBech32;
  const collateral = await beneficiary_wallet.getCollateral();
  const collateralInput = collateral[0].input;
  const collateralOutput = collateral[0].output;

  const { pubKeyHash: beneficiaryPubKeyHash } = deserializeAddress(
    beneficiary_wallet.addresses.baseAddressBech32
  );

  const datum = deserializeDatum(vestingUtxo.output.plutusData);

  const invalidBefore =
    unixTimeToEnclosingSlot(
      Math.min(datum.fields[0].int, Date.now() - 19000),
      SLOT_CONFIG_NETWORK.preview
    ) + 1;

  const txBuilder = getTxBuilder();
  await txBuilder
    .spendingPlutusScript("V3")
    .txIn(
      vestingUtxo.input.txHash,
      vestingUtxo.input.outputIndex,
      vestingUtxo.output.amount,
      scriptAddr
    )
    .spendingReferenceTxInInlineDatumPresent()
    .spendingReferenceTxInRedeemerValue("")
    .txInScript(scriptCbor)
    .txOut(beneficiaryAddress, [])
    .txInCollateral(
      collateralInput.txHash,
      collateralInput.outputIndex,
      collateralOutput.amount,
      collateralOutput.address
    )
    .invalidBefore(invalidBefore)
    .requiredSignerHash(beneficiaryPubKeyHash)
    .changeAddress(beneficiaryAddress)
    .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
    .complete();
  return txBuilder.txHex;
}
```

In this section, we define a `main` function that retrieves the transaction hash generated when we executed the `vesting_lock.mjs` file. 
This hash will be used to fetch the corresponding UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) for withdrawal.

```js filename="vesting_unlock.mjs"
// ^^^ Code above is unchanged. ^^^

async function main() {
  const txHashFromDesposit =
    //This is the hash that we generated in the locking file when we submitted the transaction.
    "ed7559c7aa5a8bfcba9ec8d75fb2ee1902da8b909722ca4726261d35e8250645";

  const utxo = await getUtxoByTxHash(txHashFromDesposit);

  if (utxo === undefined) throw new Error("UTxO not found");

  const unsignedTx = await withdrawFundTx(utxo);

  const signedTx = await beneficiary_wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);

  const txHash = await beneficiary_wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
  console.log("txHash", txHash);
}

async function getUtxoByTxHash(txHash) {
  const utxos = await blockchainProvider.fetchUTxOs(txHash);
  if (utxos.length === 0) {
    throw new Error("UTxO not found");
  }
  return utxos[0];
}

main();
}
```

<Callout>
  As you imagine, we can run this script with the following incantation:
```
node vesting_unlock.mjs
```

 </Callout>

<Callout type="info">

This should be the projects structure.
